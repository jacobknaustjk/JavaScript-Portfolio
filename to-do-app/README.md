# To-Do App

A simple and interactive To-Do application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows you to add tasks, mark them as completed (which moves them to a separate section), and delete tasks. The state of your tasks is saved in `localStorage` so that they persist between sessions.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Enter a new task and press "Add" or hit the "Enter" key.
- **Mark as Completed:** Click on a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks are automatically moved to the "Completed Tasks" section.
- **Delete Tasks:** Click the delete icon (Ã—) to remove a task.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in `localStorage` and persist even after the page is reloaded.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the application.
- **CSS3:** For styling the user interface with a modern, responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** For the interactive functionality of adding, completing, and deleting tasks.
